## Use with care!

The NLQuery engine is capable of executing CRUD operations on your database. To mitigate potential risks and prevent unintended modifications, ensure that users have restricted privileges and proper access control mechanisms in place.

## Data Privacy

Neither the NLQuery API nor the web interface stores any user-related data, query history, or session information on server side application(mbase_nlquery). mbase_nlquery do not monitor, log, or retain any generated SQL queries. To enhance response quality, your generated SQL history is temporarily stored only in a client-side variable within your browser if the webui option enabled. This data is not saved in local storage, cookies, or any persistent storage, and it is lost when the page is refreshed or closed. However, since the application is open-source this behavior can be altered by manual code implementations.

## Liability Disclaimer

We are not responsible for any unintended modifications, data loss, or security risks resulting from the use of this application. Users are solely responsible for managing their database permissions and the result of the SQL query that has been executed on your database. Use at your own risk.
